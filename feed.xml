      I’ve been working on dStore for
months.  dStore is a rewrite of an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant
distributed no-sql data store; It’s my personal DynamoDB.

Anyways, there are 3 main parts I want to get done before I can really
start showing off the project. The data node itself, the control plane
and the proxy.  Once they are done, then I’m going to start closing
the gaps between this and Dyna...

      I’m writing DynamoDB. Well, re-writing it. Not that I wrote it the
first time.  But I’m creating a ‘weak reference’ clone based on the
original. The idea is you could have the benefits of a multi-tenant
key/value datastore with the features of DynamoDB including
scalability, security and reliability.

Really, this started because I wanted to write a control plane that
manages hash ranges for in...

      Yeah, so… I deleted my twitter account.

I know, no one really cares.  If you want to follow me now, go to my
Mastodon account. But this post
isn’t really about that.

I created my Twitter account in 2008. A bunch of folks I worked with
at Corpedia did and I joined them to keep in touch. Some of the
people I worked with knew others at Twitter at the time too, so I got
to learn a bit about what ...

      I decided to make my internal libGDX library available on
github. There is nothing
proprietary about it and it could be useful to others. I used it for a
few games on Android back when I had my CodeHead google account.  It
got the job done. Basically has the following features:


  Unlike the default libGDX project, it uses Dagger for IOC by default.
  The project structure is more inline with ...

      The tooling available internally at Amazon was great, but after spending close
to five years there, I realized I’m not well versed in tooling for modern Java
projects as much. Working on terrapin has forced me to look at available
tooling for reuse, and rebuild what I missed. Here are some of my current
open-source tools I’m using today. Some old, some new.
