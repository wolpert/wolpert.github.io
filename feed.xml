      Yeah, so… I deleted my twitter account.

I know, no one really cares.  If you want to follow me now, go to my
Mastodon account. But this post
isn’t really about that.

I created my Twitter account in 2008. A bunch of folks I worked with
at Corpedia did and I joined them to keep in touch. Some of the
people I worked with knew others at Twitter at the time too, so I got
to learn a bit about what ...

      I decided to make my internal libGDX library available on
github. There is nothing
proprietary about it and it could be useful to others. I used it for a
few games on Android back when I had my CodeHead google account.  It
got the job done. Basically has the following features:


  Unlike the default libGDX project, it uses Dagger for IOC by default.
  The project structure is more inline with ...

      The tooling available internally at Amazon was great, but after spending close
to five years there, I realized I’m not well versed in tooling for modern Java
projects as much. Working on terrapin has forced me to look at available
tooling for reuse, and rebuild what I missed. Here are some of my current
open-source tools I’m using today. Some old, some new.

      I’ve made a bunch of progress on Terrapin but I still have a ways to go.

Terrapin is a third-party data management service. Specifically, it manages access and availability to data about any 3rd party using terms required by that third party. It does not store the data itself, rather ensures safe encryption of the data, and access only when all parties agree to the terms.

      Last weekend I switched to roasting a new Ethiopia Yirga Cheffe called
Kebele Gotiti.
I’m using my Behmor 2000AB which has been working well for the last few months. I get city+ or full city roasts typically. But last week I ran out of my old Yirga Cheffe and switched to this new one. I have 10 pounds to go through, and I basically use 12oz a week, so this will take at least 2 months to use. At...
