      For years I’ve had this love affair with Java. It’s like an old friend that I can hang with all night. I did stray for a few years with Ruby, but I always came back. Java was stable, repeatable, and everyone else knew what to expect.

I started playing with Rust. It’s annotations feel like pound(#) defines left over from C… and you are forced to identify how you’ll use every variable to avoid h...

      A friend introduced me to a little rust app called topgrade which runs all the update commands on your system. This is surprisingly good and wanted to post it here. Runs on Unix/Linux, Mac and windows.

This is really more than automating a package manager… though it makes sure everything is up-to-date for the system first. It also looks for updates with other installed managers, like sdkman or...

      I’ve been an emacs user since 1992. Back then I was a chemist… and taking notes meant having a physical lab notebook with a specific page format. The notebook was always away from the experiments… which ensured that in case of an accident those who remain could see what I did wrong by reading my notebook.

Using a computer for those notes was not allowed back then. (Fear of not easily being abl...

      The new website is really just jekyll on github right now. I’m not using github pages itself, rather just running the jekyll engine to build the site and post it on github.io raw. The idea is I could move the website anywhere I wanted to if github got annoying.

The advantage of hosting on github.io like I do now is two fold:


  It’s free.
  If I don’t use gitpages engine, then there are no ‘a...

      For years I’ve wanted to get rid of wordpress. And I started the Jekyll webiste here years ago… just never got it to where I wanted. Now I’ve made the switch.

Is this gonna get me to write more?  Maybe. Not by itself. Rather what I’m doing is making it easy for me to write new posts. That was always my goal. We’ll see if this works.
