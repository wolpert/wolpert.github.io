      I’ve been an emacs user since 1992. Back then I was a chemist… and taking notes meant having a physical lab notebook with a specific page format. The notebook was always away from the experiments… which ensured that in case of an accident those who remain could see what I did wrong by reading my notebook.

Using a computer for those notes was not allowed back then. (Fear of not easily being abl...

      The new website is really just jekyll on github right now. I’m not using github pages itself, rather just running the jekyll engine to build the site and post it on github.io raw. The idea is I could move the website anywhere I wanted to if github got annoying.

The advantage of hosting on github.io like I do now is two fold:


  It’s free.
  If I don’t use gitpages engine, then there are no ‘a...

      For years I’ve wanted to get rid of wordpress. And I started the Jekyll webiste here years ago… just never got it to where I wanted. Now I’ve made the switch.

Is this gonna get me to write more?  Maybe. Not by itself. Rather what I’m doing is making it easy for me to write new posts. That was always my goal. We’ll see if this works.

      Google’s internal library Truth has been released as version 1.0. It maintained by the Guava people, and is designed to work for both Java and Android according to their page. (Though not sure exactly what the Android tweaks are.)

I like the API for Truth and AssertJ and their error messages. Honestly I’ve been using jUnit’s assertion library mostly because I’m lazy. Though I’m considering swi...

I don’t get it. Typically I cannot handle most modern shows. Take Game of Thrones. Its filled with violence and incest. I’m not a prude by any standard, but it’s simply too much for me. To be fair, most shows these days I’d rather not watch. So it’s nice when the rare show pops up that I can handle watching.
