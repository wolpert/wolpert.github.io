      With the demise of Authy’s desktop app, I’ve spent the last few days
trying to rebuild it.  I have the codes I need, and can totally do
this with a command line utility.  But what I want is the app on desktop
and mobile device. For a moment I considered rust, but rust GUI isn’t
really a thing. Flutter, however, basically works everywhere. Did a few
tests and I can totally do what I want with it...

      These last few months started strong but ended up slowing down
code-wise. I renamed dStore to
svarm and got lots done with
it. When I last left it, I was working on the data replication
logic. I have a plan in place, but I got distracted.  A friend and I
decided to start a different project. I won’t go into too much detail
on it since it is not an open-source project, but I will say it was a

      I’ve been working on dStore for
months.  dStore is a rewrite of an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant
distributed no-sql data store; It’s my personal DynamoDB.

Anyways, there are 3 main parts I want to get done before I can really
start showing off the project. The data node itself, the control plane
and the proxy.  Once they are done, then I’m going to start closing
the gaps between this and Dyna...

      I’m writing DynamoDB. Well, re-writing it. Not that I wrote it the
first time.  But I’m creating a ‘weak reference’ clone based on the
original. The idea is you could have the benefits of a multi-tenant
key/value datastore with the features of DynamoDB including
scalability, security and reliability.

Really, this started because I wanted to write a control plane that
manages hash ranges for in...

      Yeah, so… I deleted my twitter account.

I know, no one really cares.  If you want to follow me now, go to my
Mastodon account. But this post
isn’t really about that.

I created my Twitter account in 2008. A bunch of folks I worked with
at Corpedia did and I joined them to keep in touch. Some of the
people I worked with knew others at Twitter at the time too, so I got
to learn a bit about what ...
