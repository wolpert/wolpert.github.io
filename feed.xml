      I’ve made a bunch of progress on Terrapin but I still have a ways to go.

Terrapin is a third-party data management service. Specifically, it manages access and availability to data about any 3rd party using terms required by that third party. It does not store the data itself, rather ensures safe encryption of the data, and access only when all parties agree to the terms.

      Last weekend I switched to roasting a new Ethiopia Yirga Cheffe called
Kebele Gotiti.
I’m using my Behmor 2000AB which has been working well for the last few months. I get city+ or full city roasts typically. But last week I ran out of my old Yirga Cheffe and switched to this new one. I have 10 pounds to go through, and I basically use 12oz a week, so this will take at least 2 months to use. At...

      I spent almost 5 years at Amazon… and learned so much there. I
really do appreciate that experience. The tooling available for
developers was quite good, and really focused on providing benefits to
the developers and then getting out of the way. Everything existed as
an optional component. If you had a better way to do something you
could. Though there are many things I miss from Amazon, like t...

      For the past 15 years, I’ve had CodeHead Systems hosted on G Suites, the Google office domain apps. What was a free service is now forcing users to upgrade to a paid plan. I cannot say I blame them; rather I’m impressed they still have the service and didn’t just shut it down. But my company/pet-project ‘CodeHead’ does not benefit from G Suites at this rate, save the publishing of Android apps....

      My framework laptop continues to impress me. Does it replace my monster desktop? No. (8 cores versus 32, 32G versus 128G) But it can definitely hold it’s own. It’s not fair to compare it to my old maxed out pixelbook, and the pixelbook was underpowered. But what is more important is this: I would not have bought that desktop if I already had this laptop. I cannot say that for any other laptop I...
