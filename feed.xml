      Got the framework laptop a few days ago… put it together and installed Ubuntu 21.10. Pretty much everything worked very well. There was some video issues where it would pause a bit for half a second then continue. But everything else including the track-pad and WiFi were great.

To fix the video issue, I upgraded the kernel from 5.13 to 5.14 (5.14.21 specifically) and no problems. The laptop is...

      I’ve been using a 2017 pixelbook as my laptop for years. This is the maxed
out version; i7, 16G RAM, 512G drive, and runs linux on a VM internally via Crostini. I can run Intelij on it, Emacs, and everything else I need just fine.

Well, no… I’m lying.

It’s definitely slow. Since 2017 it’s been getting slower all the time as everything else is getting larger. Intelij is really just a hog these...

      For years I’ve had this love affair with Java. It’s like an old friend that I can hang with all night. I did stray for a few years with Ruby, but I always came back. Java was stable, repeatable, and everyone else knew what to expect.

I started playing with Rust. It’s annotations feel like pound(#) defines left over from C… and you are forced to identify how you’ll use every variable to avoid h...

      A friend introduced me to a little rust app called topgrade which runs all the update commands on your system. This is surprisingly good and wanted to post it here. Runs on Unix/Linux, Mac and windows.

This is really more than automating a package manager… though it makes sure everything is up-to-date for the system first. It also looks for updates with other installed managers, like sdkman or...

      I’ve been an emacs user since 1992. Back then I was a chemist… and taking notes meant having a physical lab notebook with a specific page format. The notebook was always away from the experiments… which ensured that in case of an accident those who remain could see what I did wrong by reading my notebook.

Using a computer for those notes was not allowed back then. (Fear of not easily being abl...
