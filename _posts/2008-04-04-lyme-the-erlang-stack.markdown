An article was recently published where someone suggested <a href="http://21ccw.blogspot.com/2008/02/lyme-vs-lamp-i.html">an Erlang based web-app stack.</a> Now, so me this sounds cool, and of course, highly scalable. I was going to 'review' git and mercurial as svn replacements, but honestly I have no real need to do that. I have no real need to review LYME either, but frankly that is more interesting.

I'm just imagining a freakishly large system from this simple stack. Now, imagine I could write my poker server in Erlang, I could beat out the competing commercial poker servers with this beasty. Of course, Using Jabber communications for the client via <a href="http://www.ejabberd.im/">Ejabberd.</a>
