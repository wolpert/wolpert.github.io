I made some potatoes and spinach recipe for the family using a great recipe from [Vegan Dad](http://vegandad.blogspot.com/2009/04/indian-style-potatoes-and-spinach.html). Jacob liked it a lot, even if he's not into spicy food. It's not that spicy of a recipe, but I have a tendency to overdo it a bit. I highly recommend this recipe.
