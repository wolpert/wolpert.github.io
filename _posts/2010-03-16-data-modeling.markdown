Interesting [post about still needing a data model](http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/451094148/nosql-data-modeling) when dealing with non-SQL based datastores. I remember watching a video about using Cassandra and when talking about designing with it, the speaker mentioned that with Cassandra, you have to [know how your going to model the data and access it ](http://soa.dzone.com/print/18775)'more so' then you would with a RDBMS.
