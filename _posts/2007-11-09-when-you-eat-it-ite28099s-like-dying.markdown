The [Ghost Chili Pepper](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20058096/) is [the hottest chili pepper](http://hubpages.com/hub/Ghost_chili_is_named_Worlds_Hottest_Pepper) [in the world](http://www.slashfood.com/2007/08/12/an-exercise-in-ghost-chili-masochism/).[ Damn hot.](http://www.nmsu.edu/~ucomm/Releases/2007/february/hottest_chile.htm)

Below here is a video of an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK2Y1hv9mY&eurl=hornyoyster.com/video-youtube.php?id=MvK2Y1hv9mY&title=Reporter%20owned%20by%20hot%20pepper%20video">ESPN personality</a> chomping on one without knowing what it is. I love hot food, but that's insane.

BTW, in case some folks don't know... At one point, I ate hot food for fun like some folks do sports. When peppers weren't hot enough I went for hot sauces with [capsaicin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin) extracts. The hottest I had was 1.5M heat units... ate some though it did hurt. I'm no where near what I could once do, but I have to admit... I have to try one.  Just one...
