It was recently revealed that years ago Steve Jobs [threatened](http://gizmodo.com/5489531/steve-jobs-threatening-phone-call-revealed?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gizmodo%2Ffull+%28Gizmodo%29) Schwartz (Sun Microsystems) and Schwartz reminded Steve about Sun's own patient portfolio, and the fact that they take from others too. (Keynote vs. Concurrence, Mac on Unix, etc) The basis of that phone call is the reason I hate Apple. Sun wasn't all roses either, but Apple is now, and has been for years, slimy.
