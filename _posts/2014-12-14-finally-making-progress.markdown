I finally took my cousin's advice and I'm making a game with a story to it. I've made some progress getting a generic RPG together with libgdx where the game flow, stories, npcs and loot/abilities are loaded in dynamically. This means the it will be easy to enhance over time. I'm going to add in the ability for friends to play against the same map at the same time, in a serverless connection. That's something I've wanted to build into my games for a while.
