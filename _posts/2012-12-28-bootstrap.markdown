On the rare occasions I'm doing front-end work, I like someone else to make the design and give me what they want. But I have this project I'm doing on at home, and there isn't anyone else to make the design. This means I have to come up with something that looks 'reasonable' and easy to use. By myself. Without whining.

I'd like to thank Jay for introducing me to [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html). Now, at least, the site looks reasonable.Â
