[![](http://codeheadsystems.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/mario.jpg)](http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/28/mario-live-wallpaper-for-android-better-than-a-tanooki-suit-in/)As of now Android is my only smartphone operating system. WebOS is dead to me. Why you ask? Because now you can get Mario running around as a live wallpaper for Android. Unless WebOS starts using Tempest controls I'm done. The is awesome.

I figured out today that Android doesn't combine instance messaging and SMS messaging in the same app, which pissed me off. Luckily, this made it all better.

Long live Mario^h^h^h^h^hAndroid!
