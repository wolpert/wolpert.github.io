According to [NY Times](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/), Amazon is remotely deleting purchased books by Orwell. Apparently the publisher no longer wants electronic copies on the kindle, so Amazon is deleting already purchased copies remotely, and giving credits in accounts when they do.

Okay, so now I'm rethinking that Amazon's approach to the Kindle is good... because this basically says 'ownership' is revoked with no possible alternative. Amazon is in complete control... which is too much.
