Just found [Assembla](http://www.assembla.com/), which provides team/project hosting. Handles Subversion, Mercurial, Git, trac, tickets, blogs, job posting, etc. You can even make your projects protected from the public. Free accounts give you just about everything, and 500M of disk space. $12.50/Month gives you 5Gigs of space, SSL, email/phone support...Â  Looks really good.
