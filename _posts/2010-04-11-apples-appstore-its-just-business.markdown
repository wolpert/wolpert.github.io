A good post describing why Apple is [killing the 3rd party tools](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/why_apple_changed_section_331) to convert flash/.net/etc apps to iphone apps has been [endorsed by Steve Jobs as 'insightful'](http://www.taoeffect.com/blog/2010/04/steve-jobs-response-on-section-3-3-1/). Simply put, Apple is pulling plays from IBM and Microsoft's playbook of the past. Its only business folks. Of course, I think its short-sighted and will work against Apple in the long-run, but time will tell.
