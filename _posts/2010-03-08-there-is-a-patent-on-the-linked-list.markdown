As recently pointed out by [Juixe](http://juixe.com/techknow/index.php/2010/03/04/us-patent-linked-list/), the US government has given a patent on the linked list to [LSI Logic Corp](http://www.google.com/patents?id=Szh4AAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false) who filed for the patent in 2002. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), the linked list was first used in the 1950's. Can we now agree that US patent system is broken?

Linked list... I'm surprised no one has a patent on [multiplying binary numbers](http://www.google.com/patents?id=xKcuAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4&source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false).
