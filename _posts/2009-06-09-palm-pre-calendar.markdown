For the last weekend, I couldn't see my calendar on my pre, even though it was alerting me to my events. Finally figured out that the problem was I had too many calendars. My work Google calendar lists 20 calendars in total, and home has about 8... so the display was just over-whelmed. On the pre I just told it not to display most of the calendars in the 'all calendar view' and everything works fine now. Of course, then I removed calendars from my other accounts that I don't care about anymore either.
