After my last post about the hazards of using raw chemicals in food production, I felt the need to point out that the concept of chemical processing isn't bad in itself. Let me give a specific example. Lye is used for lots of stuff. To a chemist, its simply sodium hydroxide. You use lye to make soap. You really cannot make soap without it. You also use it for ﻿﻿lutefisk, hominy and even pretzels. Lye is very dangerous, no question. But it is very valuable for food preparation. You cannot make authentic German pretzels without 'chemically processing' and its not just fine, its tasty.

The idea of chemical processing just sounds bad to many people. My objection was with the specific use of hexane in the production of food. I have the same response with using ethanol from corn for fuel; what is the impact of doing this. Hexane is noxious to the environment and overused as it is, not to mention soy being overused in general. If corn is being used for ethanol, the price of groceries will skyrocket. These are 'bad things'; not because you cannot use hexane for food or because you cannot use ethanol for fuel. But because of everything that comes with them.

Now take genetically modified food... like corn. Yes corn. For thousands of years humans have restricted the growth of corn that have turned it into what it is today. Its not a bad thing. Same with tomatoes, (though I like the taste of non-US tomatoes better) humans use simple evolutionary principles in standard farming practices that provide for better yields of their crops. This is actually a good thing. What's bad is that farmers have to buy new seed from their provider and cannot reuse seed from one crop the next year, but the concept of genetically modified crops is not bad. Gene-splicing has gotten a bad rap, but from a science perspective, its a fair thing to do. (How its marketed and how crops are legally protected and 'patented' is a problem, but the food itself is fine.)

The food you eat is more then just stuff to shove into your gaping maw. It has a source and developing the food has an impact even if you cannot see it directly. There is a social component to meals that modern US society has lost. Certain raw chemicals shouldn't be used in food production (hexane, benzene) and others are just fine (salt, ethanol) though like everything else, moderation is key. Regardless of if you eat Twinkies on a regular basis, abstain from meat or find benzene-laced decaf coffee the best, you owe it to yourself, and your neighbors, in learning 'how' the stuff you eat is made, what's in it, and what is the impact of eating it.
