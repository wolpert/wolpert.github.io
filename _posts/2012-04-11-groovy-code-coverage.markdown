After reading a post about what [not to test](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565), discussed with a friend about how to determine where you need complete code coverage, and where you don't. Resulting idea is that the more complex the code, the more code coverage it should have. So, going to experiment with Jenkins, [Sonar](http://www.sonarsource.org/) and [GMetrics](http://gmetrics.sourceforge.net/). Â Article on integration is [here.](http://java.dzone.com/articles/grails-hudson-jenkins-part-6)
