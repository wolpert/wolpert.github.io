I just uploaded to [github](https://github.com/wolpert/kubeOnPi) a set of instructions and scripts that I'm using to install kubernetes on raspberry Pis. I've run into some weird funk due to the [arm OS install](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/49a02s/arm64_images_for_raspberry_pi_3/) on the arm64 processor, and that many containers assume amd64. But this is a start.

The next steps is simplify the install a bit more, and add in instructions to include heapster and kubernetes-dashboard that is compatible. I'm planning on updating to a kernel that is arm64 compatible so I can do more fun stuff.Â  (Mesos)
