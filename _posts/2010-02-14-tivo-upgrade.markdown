With the Olympics being broadcast in HD on NBC, we wanted to get all of it on the TiVo. But our HD TiVo is basically out of room with the digital feed already on it. (We get OTA HD) So, I wanted to get a new 1TB drive external to it. Well, I simply could not find a 'supported' one. (No to Best Buy, Fry's, Amazon without spending $350, even WD online was out-of-stock). So, with a quick look at [this thread](http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?p=5616160#instructions) I decided to go for it.

The warranty is now voided, but I have to say that the insides are pretty spartan and nice. Hopefully when its copied over all will work and I won't have to look to buy a new one by messing this up.
