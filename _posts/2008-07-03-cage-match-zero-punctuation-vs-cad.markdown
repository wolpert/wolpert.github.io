Some of you may read [Ctrl+Alt+Del](http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/) and some may watch [Zero Punctuation](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/108-Webcomics) game reviews. Now you can watch Zero complain about CAD. Its kinda funny, not Zero's best work, but does make a decent point. Game comics should be about games. The current CAD 'theme' doesn't bother me. But it does seem obvious the Zero ran out of games to talk about. To me, that's the real crime.
