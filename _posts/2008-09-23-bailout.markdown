I get the feeling that the US is screwed with or without the current bailout. So why is Bush and company pushing it so hard? I think it benefits them most after they are out of office but I have no clue how. This does not protect people's money and this does not protect home-owners. This only protects companys who made bad choices, and potentially the foreign markets view on the US as a stable financial market. And if anything, this also proves that the 'free market' is not a good idea if the 'free market' folks want/need this bailout.

Oh, and the original request required no oversight or governance. Bad sign... (Check out Leahy's change made to section eight, end of the link below)
