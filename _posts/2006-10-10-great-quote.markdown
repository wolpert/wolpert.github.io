So, here it is, 8:45pm.  We put Jacob to bed about an hour ago.  The DVR taped Daily Show and Family Guy.  Half-way into the Family guy episode, Jacob calls from his room, "What's so funny?"  Guess I was laughing fairly loud, and he never did go to sleep.  After explaining that the show on the TV was funny and tucking him into bed, he says:  "_I wish when I  grow up I can laugh like you do._"

So do I Jacob... so do I.
