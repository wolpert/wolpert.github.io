Not sure how many people read my tumblr log... its basically a dumping ground of random stuff. But last Sept 17, 2008 I noticed a huge spike in the price of gold that came out of nowhere, and [posted it](http://codehead.tumblr.com/post/50589732/i-want-to-know-what-happened-on-sept-17-at-9-55am). It seemed like someone was manipulating the market.Â  Well, thanks to one of the 2 people who actually watch C-SPAN, we [now know](http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-world-almost-came-to-end-at-2pm-on.html) that around that time money market accounts in the US were being depleted. The gold-spike we had was akin to water at the beach retreating before the tidal wave comes in. I still feel that to achieve such a spike in the gold market required automatic trades initiated from computers, but I have no proof.
