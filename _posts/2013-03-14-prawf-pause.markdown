Due to [unforeseen circumstances](http://support.google.com/reader/answer/3028851), I'm going to temporarily pause prawf development.

Since ATOM came out, I've futz'd with news readers; but Google Reader made me lazy. Kirsten too. Thanks to Google's desire to route out all the ways to [avoid advertisements](http://www.pocketables.com/2013/03/google-is-shutting-down-google-reader-on-july-1st.html), I think I'm going to try to build the news reader I want. Comic and podcast friendly, android app too. 'Cloud' based for story sync.

It may not work, but this is the best time to try. I'm gonna miss the Reader... gonna be hard to code through all these tears...
