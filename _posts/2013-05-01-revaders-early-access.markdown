[![Revaders](http://revaders.codeheadsystems.com/logo256x256.png)](http://revaders.codeheadsystems.com)I finished up the first early access release done for Revaders, and its now available on Google Play. I'm looking for comments on the game and to see how people think it should progress. It's the first game I wrote in a long time, and I used this as a way to learn the PlayN framework. PlayN allows you to write games for many platforms. Currently supports Java, Android, HTML via GWT, Flash and iOS. Â I have a lot of changes I'm planning on this game, but open to ideas people have. Download it and let me know what you think.[![](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeheadsystems.revaders.android)
