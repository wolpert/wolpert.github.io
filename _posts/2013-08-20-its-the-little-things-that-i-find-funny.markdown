Prawf was intended to be a '**Pra**ctical **W**ork**f**low Engine'. I had put together the words years ago thinking it didn't mean anything else.[![Image](http://codeheadsystems.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screenshot-from-2013-08-20-083702.png?w=358)](http://codeheadsystems.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screenshot-from-2013-08-20-083702.png)

Apparently it (mostly) means "Test" in [Welsh](http://www.geiriadur.net/index.php?page=ateb&term=prawf&direction=we&type=all&whichpart=exact). I found this out months ago, but figured since no one reserved the domain name 'prawf.com' by now, it simply wasn't that popular.

Since I started prawf.com, I've gotten random spam as anyone would. This one email that wasn't spam caught my eye. It was from someone at gwynedd.gov.uk, which I thought was a fake hostname. Turns out its real. The email was a 'test' email. It was a reply from a filled out form to this website, with each filed in the form set to 'prawf'. Instead of the email address of the person filling out the form being 'test@test.com', it was set to 'prawf@prawf.com'. 

I have a habit of deleting spam regularly, rather then letting google delete it after 30 days. CodeHeadSystems.com never got that much spam, but prawf.com does. I think I'm going to start reviewing the spam folder there 'just to see' how much of it is 'test' messages.
