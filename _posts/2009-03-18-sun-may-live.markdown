It looks like Big Blue may [purchase the Sun](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/technology/companies/19sun.html). This would only be good for Sun and specifically, benefit Java developers big time, as IBM is really one reason why Java is as successful as it is today.

But at my core, I wonder what would happen to the recently purchased MySQL folks compared to DB2 and the PostgreSQL support team. I have no clue on how IBM's very strong database group would view those segments.
