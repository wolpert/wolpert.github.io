Rcov is a great tool to verify what code is touched by test cases. Its only C0 testing, in that it checks that the code is hit for a test but not testing for all possible permitations.

The original project is all but abandonded and several forks on github.com have come out. The latest one that I like the most is the [relevance](http://github.com/relevance/rcov/tree/master) on which is based on Spicycode's fork.
